## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BLacika  
Full name: LÃ¡szlÃ³ SÃ¡ndor Balassa.  
I live in Budapest with my wife and 3-year-old son.  
I work for a company where i develop the company's own software, with Angular and Python (w/o framework).  
I am an accountant by qualification, but after 5 year of hobbyist programming, i managed to find a job as developer. That was my dream.  

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything that is developement.  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Elixir and Phoenix.  

Now, as hobby project, i work on an invoicing app (really simple) with Phoenix Framework and LiveView. (Not pushed yet)

I have a few project in my repository. I created small Java apps to helping me in my accounting work.
I created apps with Angular and Spring Boot to find a job. I found those really good.
I liked to work with Vue3 and Quasar Framework to create the invoicing app mentioned above (not finished yet).
Learning Svelte is also on my bucket list. I really like its simplicity and the fact that it is compiled.
